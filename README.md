# JMXwithTransforming
This project runs any given main.class files using Executors with some frequency through Java Management Extensions (or JMX). 
Also, it has "profiling": only after loading main.class file, profiling stops an execution of this class, transforms it with method of counting an elapsed time of loading and then executes modified .class file with printing an execution time with given frequency.
